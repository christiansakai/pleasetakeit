# PleaseTake.It

This web application was built during Fullstack Academy of Code in New York.
It is supposed to be a beautiful craigslist for local commerce.

A trailer of the app can be found here http://youtu.be/7RbprRE3WtA.

It is a basic setup but we stopped working on it. Take this code, keep on working and start a local commerce revolution.
